This is a tool for editing the Base and Weapons values of Units in BW1 + BW2.
It change change Allegiances, DAMAGE_VALUES, target types, weapon models, and quite a bit more. 

The tool would not have been possible without the work of Yoshi2. My tool is based on the frameworked code of his level editor. A huge thanks to him.

Compass:
(2) means that the value is used specifically for BW2 only.
(U) means used by that unit. (U)HMG/Infrantry means the target type is used by those Units.
